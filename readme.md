# This is an abandoned idea.
Originally I wanted to generate a custom site from a custom markdown flavor (DCMS), but the maud crate apprears to not support what im trying to do.

also i could just use another markdown to html generator crate... lol

this was a fun exercise tho, i think im a bit better at trees and recursion now.

anyways the most interesting part is probably the `make_valid_header_site` in main.rs , as it shows a working demo of converting a string into something i thought maud would recognize.

Everything was designed (hopefully) for modularity, but i didn't end up implementing more than the header detection before i realized i couldn't do what i wanted to do.



## is this code good
probably not, but look around and steal whatever you want.

## where are the css files

they're mine, you cant have them. >:)
